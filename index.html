	<h1>Hi, I'm Milda Norkute</h1>
	<h2>
        At the moment I'm in between websites. However, I've summarized some of the highlights below --
	</h2>
	<p>I'm <span style="font-weight: 1000">currently</span> a Senior Designer at Thomson Reuters Labs. I assume you came here to download the preprint of my <span style="font-weight: bold">CHI2021 paper</span> <a target="_blank" href="./../assets/NorkuteXAI.pdf">Towards Explainable AI: Assessing the Usefulness and Impact of Added Explainability Features in Legal Document Summarization</a>. It is a pretty good representation of what kind of work I do at the labs. Though most of it is confidential.</p>
    <p>Before Thomson Reuters I worked as Designer and Front End Developer at CERN <span style="font-weight: bold">(2018-2019)</span> and Nokia <span style="font-weight: bold">(2017 summer)</span>.</p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2016-2018</span>, I completed a double masters in Human Computer Interaction and Design at Aalto University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology.</p>
	<p>Before starting my career in technology, <span style="font-weight: bold">2014-2016</span> I worked in media research at Newsworks, in London. I graduated with bachelors degree in Psychology from University Bath with first class honours in <span style="font-weight: bold">2014</span>. I also spent a year working in academic research at New Zealand Institute of Language Brain and Behaviour between <span style="font-weight: bold">2012-2013</span>.</p>
